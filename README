LibFloorplan

learning from large floorplan datasets

WORKS:
- Loading and saving graphs from XML, boost::serialization
- Area and degree distributions can be generated & saved to file

TODO:
- Regarding graph structure:
- Clustering coefficient (this is a value that indicates how "star
shaped" the neighbors of a label is)
- Average path length (average number of edges needed to travel to
this vertex from all other vertices)
- DONE Average degree (number of edges that a node has) for various orders
(immediate neighbors, neighbors of neighbors etc.)

Regarding geometric properties, the polygon layout of a room:
- DONE Area
- Shape (simply square or elongated)
- Perimeter length
- Number of vertices of the room's layout (i.e. how "zigzaggy" the perimeter
  is)
- Convexity measure of the room's layout (ratio of polygon's area to
it's convex hull)
- Average vertex angle of the room's layout
- Door width

Regarding other structure:
- Number of windows (only available in the KTH dataset)
